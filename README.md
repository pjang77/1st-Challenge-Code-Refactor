# 1st-Challenge-Code-Refactor
HTML-Git-CSS Challenge

Acceptance Criteria 
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
    The semantics that I edited were the following to help identify exactly what each section of the HTML were. 
    1. I changed the div tag on line 11 to header tag 
    2. I changed the div tag on line 13 to a nav tag to indicate that this section is the Navigation tab *I had to adjust the div in CSS to show nav so that the page would still operate properly and not break.
    3. I changed the div tag on line 27 to a main tag to indicate that this is the main content section
    4. I added an id on line 29 because the "search engine optimization" section only had a class but not an id like its other counterparts in that main content section.
    5. I changed the div tag on line 51 to an aside tag to indicate that this section is the content on the side.
    6. I added the appropriate alt descriptions in lines 30,37,44,54,61, and 68. 
    7. I changed the div tag on line 74 to a footer tag
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
    1. The structure seemed good to me
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
    1. I added the appropriate alt descriptions in lines 30,37,44,54,61, and 68. 
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
    1. This seemed okay
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title 
    1. changed the contents inside title tag to Horiseon.
